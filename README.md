### Repository to replicate NYTimes Dash app

Inspired by Dash gallery [New York Times yield curve](https://plot.ly/dash/gallery/yield-curve/).

### Contents:
* **slider.py** demonstrates a simple slider you can use to visualize different graphs.
* **graph.py** defines some functions used to create a [3-D Surface plot](https://plot.ly/python/3d-surface-plots/) in Dash.
* **paraboloid.py** demonstrates the generalizability of graph.py to any fn z(x, y).
